# Auth GraphQL

**Handling authentication** with **GraphQL** is tricky and can be hard to implement if you are not familiar with the auth-flow when working with Apollo Client. This is a simple app which covers all the concepts of handling authentication in React apps using Apollo Client and GraphQL.

## The project includes:
1. GraphQL API consumption using Apollo Client.
2. Managing authentication in GraphQL. Concept of protected and unprotected routes depending on whether user is logged in or not.

## How to run?
There is another public repository [auth-graphql-server](https://github.com/Asfand038/auth-graphql-server). Follow the guidelines in that repository to run server on your local development machine. After you successfully run the server, you can run this app on your local development machine by following the steps provided below:

1. Clone the repo or download zip file.
2. Install dependencies by running the script `npm install`.
3. Run the app by running the script `npm start`. The app will run on localhost:3000.
